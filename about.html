            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) carries millions of trips each month across subway, bus and commuter rail services. New England weather, such as rain, snow, strong wind and low visibility, can disrupt operations and create delays for many riders. Key Bus Routes are especially important for neighborhoods that rely on bus service as their main connection to jobs, schools and healthcare.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project links historical reliability data from the MBTA Open Data Portal with daily weather observations from the National Centers for Environmental Information at Logan Airport. Our aim is to measure how different weather conditions relate to MBTA on time performance and to highlight patterns that matter for everyday commuting.

            <h2>Our Motivation</h2>
            <p>
                Commuting in Boston is difficult even on a clear day and it becomes more stressful when the weather changes suddenly. As extreme and unusual weather becomes more common, riders and agencies need guidance based on data rather than isolated stories or impressions.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main motivation of this website is to help people understand how much extra delay bad weather can introduce and which parts of the system are most affected. By turning past delays into visual summaries, we hope to give commuters, planners and the Northeastern community a clearer picture of what to expect when the forecast looks uncertain.

                    <p>
                        Hi, I'm Shanghao. I am responsible for the web development and data visualization of this project. 
                        With a background in Mathematics, I am passionate about using data science to solve real-world problems 
                        and uncovering the hidden patterns behind urban transit systems.
