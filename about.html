        <section>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) carries millions of trips each month across subway, bus and commuter rail services. New England weather, such as rain, snow, strong wind and low visibility, can disrupt operations and create delays for many riders. Key Bus Routes are especially important for neighborhoods that rely on bus service as their main connection to jobs, schools and healthcare.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project links historical reliability data from the MBTA Open Data Portal with daily weather observations from the National Centers for Environmental Information at Logan Airport. Our aim is to measure how different weather conditions relate to MBTA on time performance and to highlight patterns that matter for everyday commuting.

            <h2>Our Motivation</h2>
            <p>
                Commuting in Boston is difficult even on a clear day and it becomes more stressful when the weather changes suddenly. As extreme and unusual weather becomes more common, riders and agencies need guidance based on data rather than isolated stories or impressions.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main motivation of this website is to help people understand how much extra delay bad weather can introduce and which parts of the system are most affected. By turning past delays into visual summaries, we hope to give commuters, planners and the Northeastern community a clearer picture of what to expect when the forecast looks uncertain.

        <!-- Data Description -->
         <section>
            <h2>Data Sources & Methodology</h2>
            <p>
                To ensure the accuracy and reproducibility of this analysis, we integrated four distinct datasets covering transit operations, environmental conditions, and geospatial information.
            </p>
            
            <ul style="line-height: 1.8; color: #444; margin-top: 15px;">
                <li>
                    <strong>MBTA Reliability Data:</strong> 
                    Reliability measures are sourced from the <a href="https://mbta-massdot.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/b3a24561c2104422a78b593e92b566d5_0/explore" target="_blank" style="color: #D41B2C; text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 1px dotted #D41B2C;">MassDOT Open Data Portal</a>. 
                    The tables report daily numerator and denominator values for On Time Performance by route and mode. From these fields we compute the percentage of trips that arrive on time for each key bus route and service date, which forms the main outcome variable in our analysis.
                <li>
                    <strong>Weather Data:</strong> 
                    Weather conditions are retrieved through the Meteostat Python library using a point near Boston Logan International Airport as a reference location. 
                    For each calendar day we obtain total precipitation, total snowfall, average temperature and mean wind speed. These daily summaries are matched to MBTA service dates so that each day of reliability data is paired with the corresponding local weather.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Geospatial Data:</strong> 
                    Shapefiles for bus routes and stops were obtained from <a href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/massgis-data-mbta-bus-routes-and-stops" target="_blank" style="color: #D41B2C; text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 1px dotted #D41B2C;">MassGIS</a>. 
                    These layers provide the geometry and location of key bus corridors across the Greater Boston area and are used to build interactive route maps and spatial visualizations, ensuring that reliability patterns are displayed in their correct geographic context.

                <li>
                    <strong>Ridership Data:</strong> 
                    Historical ridership indicators for MBTA bus routes between 2016 and 2025 are taken from the <a href="https://dashboard.transitmatters.org/bus/ridership/?busRoute=1&startDate=2016-02-01&endDate=2025-12-01" target="_blank" style="color: #D41B2C; text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 1px dotted #D41B2C;">TransitMatters Data Dashboard</a>. 
                    These data summarise passenger volumes by route and year, which allows us to compare how weather related reliability patterns differ between higher ridership corridors and routes with lower demand.
